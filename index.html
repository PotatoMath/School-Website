We ended up with a red tailed black cockatoo called Bimbi! PBL stands for positive behavior for learning. PBL has three main values. Safe, Respectful and Learner. This will help TPS students learn while having fun!</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">In 2021, Torrens Primary started Year 6 Parliment in order to improve the school, not just by the teacher's perspective but from the children's perspective. In parliment, we have different committees to represent Torrens PS. For example, Year 2 Committee or Media Committee (which is the committee I am in). To elect the leaders of these committees, we had to prepare a speech and present it to the whole of Year 6! After we chose our committee leaders, we sorted ourselfs into different committees by choice. However, there was only a specific amount of members in each group. Parliment would have two parts. Parliment in session and a time to work on bills. Once the bill is passed by the lower house, it would have to be passed by The Senet (which are the teachers and our principal) to actually be able to do. This way, our school will be able to improve and have more fun!</p>
